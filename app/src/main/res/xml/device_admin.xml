        ARIA Device Admin Policies
        These define what capabilities the DeviceAdminReceiver (AriaDeviceAdminReceiver)
        will be able to request from the system.

        Notes:
        - We keep lock and password control to support Lost Mode functionality.
        - Data wipe is intentionally excluded for safety.
        - Compatible with Android 14+.
